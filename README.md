In this project we had to create a program that simulates a combat video game!

Here we have chosen two arch enemies Naruto and Sasuke to fight in a death combat!

This week we started learning Object Oriented Programming, we learned what a class and objects are, and how to use them.

~ Enjoy the little game! ~
